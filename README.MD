# My personal resume
this is a react project created as a technology and architecture playground. Im using some cutting edge technologies here as vite, react, contentfull and figma integration.

## figma integration
the figma design file for this project is also the source true for the scss library. All the parameters like font familes, colors, spacing, gradients, shadows, etc are exported from figma to a json token file and then converted into a css library.
Take a look into src/style-foundations

[design tokens for figma](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/888356646278934516/design-tokens) plugin to export tokens file from figma.
